### Motivation
Keeping track of finances is an important part of our everyday lives. Even though we can look at our transaction history online, it doesn't give us a clear picture of our spending habits are. For example we may wish to see what the catgorical breakdown of our spendings are. For example I may wish to see how much of my income is spent on foodj or gas. This project's goal is to provide that breakdown of our spending habits.

### Data
The data for this project is a user generated csv file. Which means that the user will have to manually enter in each transaction that they make and categorize it. I find that, at least for me, taking this extra small step makes me more conscious of my spending habits since credit cards make spending money so effortless.

### Code
The code uses OOP to track the users' spending habits. A class object is created called finances that reads in and separates the csv into categories, aggregates across categories, and then provides totals and a net income for the user.

### Use it
The most important part is that the user continously updates the csv file.
